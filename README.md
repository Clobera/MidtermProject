## Overview
ItineraryShare is a social website to share itineraries. It allows users to interact with each other around their trip itineraries, as well as review and discuss specific destinations.

## Description
On the ItineraryShare website you are greeted and shown all active itineraries. As a guest user, you are able to view public data but cannot insert any data.

The user has the option to log in at the top right, which redirects the log in screen where you can create an account or log in.

As a verified user, you can create/update/delete/bookmark itineraries made by the logged in user. Also, a verified user can create/delete itinerary items for itineraries they created. The user can also add/delete pictures to the itinerary item.
